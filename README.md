# Water Temperature Forecasting for Several TVA Sites


This project was completed by Patrick Schulkers and I for the Data Science for Engineers course during my time at the University of Tennessee.

Abstract – *Having access to early and reliable forecasts for water temperature is critical to
plant performance for the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). 55% of TVA’s power portfolio is
dependent on water from reservoirs and rivers. Using historical water temperatures and nearby
air temperatures for four sites – Cumberland Fossil Plant, Gallatin Fossil Plant, Kingston Fossil
Plant, and Tims Ford Dam – time series models were trained to produce two-week hourly water
temperature forecasts. Linear regression was the top-performing model for each site, with aver-
age mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) between 0.13% and 0.29%. The most important
predictors in the models included lagged 6 and 12 hour mean and max water temperatures and
time of day.*
